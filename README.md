My name is Jenny and I am a Data Scientist with more than 4 years of analytical experience in the banking and governmet agency. 
Currently I am a senior at the University of Western Sydney finalizing my Master degree of Data Science.
My research interest is computer/robot vision, and development of robotic solutions. 
I am working on my second research project called 'Intelligent Pantry' (the repository is in private mode) applying combination of robot vision, reinforcement/imitation learning models, hardware components, electronics and mechanical design solutions.
